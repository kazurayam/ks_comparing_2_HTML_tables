= Comparing 2 HTML <TABLE>s in Katalon Studio

This is a small Katalon Studio project for demonstration purpose. You can download the zip of the project from the https://github.com/kazurayam/ks_comparing_2_HTML_tables/releases[Releases] page, unzip it, and open it with your Katalon Studio.

This project is made in the hope to propose a solution to a topic in the Katalon Forum.

@GIO Thank you for providing us sample data

This project was made and tested using Katalon Studio v8.2.5, but it should work with any KS version.

== Problem to solve.

Some Katalon Studio users want to compare data in 2 HTML tables found in the web page of their Application Under Test. Let me assume, I have 2 pages as follows:

image::https://kazurayam.github.io/ks_comparing_2_HTML_tables/images/page1.png[page1]

image::https://kazurayam.github.io/ks_comparing_2_HTML_tables/images/page2.png[page2]

The 2 tables looks similar. But you should be able to find some differences in the data contained.

They want to scrape data out of these 2 HTML `<TABLE>` tags, and compare them.

They want their test to be able to

1. sort the rows of each tables with some reasonable keys. The above tables have a key which is a concatenation of 2 columns: "CUSTOMER" + "CHANNEL". Here we assume the key values are unique in the given data sets.

2. find if any row key in the page1 is missing out of the page2.

3. find if any row key in the page2 is missing out of the page1.

This is a *Frequently Asked Question* in the Katalon forum. So, I would present a runnable sample code for it.

== Fixture HTML

I made 2 HTML files and included in this project.

- link:./Include/web/page1.html[page1]

[source,html]
----
include::./Include/web/page1.html[]
----


- link:./Include/web/page2.html[page2]


[source,html]
----
include::./Include/web/page2.html[]
----

The Test Case `TC2` will open these 2 HTML files as `file:///` URL.


== Test Cases

I have made 3 Test Cases.

Test Case `TC1` is preparatory code. `TC1` contains 2 instances of `List<List<String>` filled with literals values, same as the screenshot images above.

Test Case `TC2` actually opens URL in web browser, scrape the HTML for the table data, constructs 2 instances of `List<List<String>>` filled with data scrape out of the web pages.

Both of `TC1` and `TC2` calls a separated Test Case `compare2datasets`. This code implements data manipulation and verifications.

=== Output

When I execute th `TC2`, I got the following output in the console.

== Discussion

I introduced several programming techniques.

1. class `Record` to encapsulate data in a row of HTML table
2. the Record has `getKey()` method that makes a combination of CUSTOMER+CHANNEL as the key which identifies a row of HTML table uniquely.
3. use `java.util.TreeMap` to make a set of Record objects automatically sorted by the key; the Record class implements `int compareTo(Record)` method.
4. use `java.util.Set` that provides `removeAll()` method which performs substitute operation of mathmatical set; the Record class implements `boolean equals(Object)` method.

Do you think this is unnecessarily complicated? I do not think so. This sample code is an absolute minimum to solve the problem that was asked to solve. The problem is a difficult one, it deserves this complexity.

However, I think that it is not a good idea to perform such full stack programming in an automated UI tests. I think such full stack programming should be carried out in the unit-tests for the web server app possibly using SQL; or the unit-tests for the JavaScript upon JSON data in the single page web app. I think automated UI test for HTML should NOT be responsible for this layer of problems.

== Conclusion

You should not try to write "compare 2 tables" in Katalon Studio. Too much complex UI automation code will not be well maintained long. Sooner or later (in a few months) it will break when the HTML design changed. Then you will remove the broken UI test out of the Test Suite. Your efforts will be in vain.

== APPENDIX

I have got another solution to the problem how to compare 2 HTML tables. Let me explain.

Previously I developed and published a project named https://forum.katalon.com/t/visual-inspection-in-katalon-studio-reborn/57440[Visual Inspection in Katalon Studio]. This project can compare some pairs of web pages of a single Web application (e.g, the Production and the Development env) by taking screenshot images and scraping HTML source codes. The https://github.com/kazurayam/materialstore[materialstore] library, on which the "Visual Inspection" project is built upon, has a good capability of making diff info of 2 text files. I found that the materialstore library is applicable to solve the "compare 2 tables" problem as well.

I made a sample that does the following steps:

1. I developed a Test Case plus a Custom Keyword.
2. The Test Case should navigate to URL of a web page with `<table>`. It will scrape the text `<table>` content and transform it to a Java object in the data type of `<List<List<String>>>` type.
3. Repeat this for 2 URLs. You will get 2 objects.
4. The Test Case will call your Custom Keyword. Your Keyword class should extend link:https://github.com/kazurayam/materialstore/blob/main/src/main/groovy/com/kazurayam/materialstore/textgrid/DefaultTextGridDiffer.groovy[`com.kazurayam.materialstore.textgrid.DefaultTextGridDiffer`]. This class implements `diffTextGrids()` method. Your Test Case will call this method while passing 3 parameters.
  - the content of the 1st `<table>` in the data type of `List<List<String>>`
  - the content of the 2nd `<table>` in the data type of `List<List<String>>`
  - the variable in the type of `java.lang.nio.file.Path` that represents a file where the report will be written into

=== Sample output

When you run "Test Cases/TC2x", you will find a HTML file created at `<projectDir>/store/TC2x-index.html`. See a sample in action:

- link:https://kazurayam.github.io/ks_comparing_2_HTML_tables/store/TC2x-index.html[store/TC2-index.html]

The diff of 2 `<table>` tags is nicely presented, isn't it?

Please note that `YourTextGridDiffer` class extends link:https://github.com/kazurayam/materialstore/blob/main/src/main/groovy/com/kazurayam/materialstore/textgrid/DefaultTextGridDiffer.groovy[`com.kazurayam.materialstore.textgrid.DefaultTextGridDiffer`] which encapsulates all detail processing, which include: 

1. the code is given with 2 Java objects of `<List<List<String>>>` type; it will transform them into JSON texts
2. the code makes the diff of 2 JSON texts using link:https://java-diff-utils.github.io/java-diff-utils/[java-diff-utils]
3. the code compiles a report in HTML format.

=== External dependencies

You need to download some externa jar files and locate them into the `Drivers` directory of your project. https://github.com/kazurayam/ks_comparing_2_HTML_tables/tree/master/Drivers[] already includes them.

1. materialstore version 0.1.11 https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.kazurayam/materialstore
2. java-diff-util version 1.3.0 https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.googlecode.java-diff-utils/diffutils
